# Iot-Bike

A system for measuring performance and setting goals for bike riding. Available as an android app. App has two modes:
* Goal Setting: Determine how fast you want to go and for how long. LED turns blue if you're going too slow,
red if you're going too fast, and green for just right
* Measuring: LED simply shows you how fast you are going on a similar scale as goal setting: blue for pretty
slow, red for pretty fast, green for in between

Also has a rainbow mode for when you just want cool looking lights while you ride!
